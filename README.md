FormFlow is an innovative web application built with Next.js, leveraging the power of Dnd-kit library for seamless drag-and-drop functionality. This project is designed with a focus on user-friendly experiences, combining ServerActions, PostgreSQL and Typescript for robust backend functionalities. The frontend is crafted with the aesthetic touch of Tailwindcss/Shadcn UI, ensuring a responsive and visually appealing design.

## Main Learning Points

Developing this drag and drop form builder was an enriching journey that allowed me to explore and integrate a variety of technologies and methodologies. Here are the key learning points:

### Next.js 13 with AppRouter
- Utilized the latest features of Next.js 13, including the new AppRouter, to build a more intuitive and dynamic routing system. This enabled seamless navigation and optimized page loads across the application.

### Dnd-kit Library
- Integrated dnd-kit to implement the drag and drop functionality. This library provided a flexible and accessible drag-and-drop toolkit, making the form designer intuitive and user-friendly.

### ServerActions
- Leveraged ServerActions for handling server-side logic, such as form submissions and data validation. This approach streamlined communication between the client and server, enhancing the application's performance and reliability.

### TypeScript
- Adopted TypeScript for its strong typing system, which improved code quality and maintainability. It facilitated early detection of errors and streamlined the development process by providing clear contracts for data structures and API responses.

### TailwindCSS / Shadcn UI
- Used TailwindCSS and Shadcn UI for styling, focusing on responsiveness and aesthetic appeal. These tools expedited the design process and enabled the creation of a sleek, modern UI with minimal effort.

### Vercel PostgreSQL and Prisma as ORM
- Integrated Vercel PostgreSQL for database management and Prisma as the ORM. This combination provided a robust and efficient solution for handling database operations, facilitating easy data manipulation and access.
